# Guidelines
+ Don't put any lines in your config files that you don't understand!
+ Keep necessary notes
 1. <small>meaningfull name</small>
 2. <small>reference url</small>

+ internal -> path -> (function - alias) -> plugin -> custom
 1. internal (shell-builtin)
 2. path (common 'PATH' stuff, normally controlled by package-manager)
 3. plugin (no dependence between each other)

+ functions with prefix '_' are used internally or cautiously
